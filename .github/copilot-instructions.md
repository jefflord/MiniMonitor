### Copilot Instructions

Here are the guidelines for using Copilot in this project:

#### Project Overview
- This is photino.net app
- The current primary interface is in index-b.html


#### Focus on TypeScript (`.ts`) Files
**Do not** modify the compiled JavaScript (`.js`) files directly. All front-end logic should be written in TypeScript. The project is set up to automatically compile `.ts` files into `.js` when changes are saved. Your focus should be on the TypeScript source code.

#### Avoid Manual Compilation
The build process handles TypeScript compilation automatically in the background. You **do not** need to run any commands like `tsc` to compile the code. When you make changes to a `.ts` file, the corresponding `.js` file will be updated by the development environment.

#### No Test Files
For this project, we are not writing unit or integration tests. Please **do not** generate any test files or test-related code. Focus solely on the core application logic and features.
